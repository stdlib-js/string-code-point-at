    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/string-code-point-at
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).
-   To use as a general utility for the command line, install the corresponding [CLI package][cli-section] globally.

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var codePointAt = require( '@stdlib/string-code-point-at' );
```

#### codePointAt( string, position\[, backward] )

Returns a Unicode [code point][code-point] from a string at a specified position.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( 'last man standing', 4 );
// returns 32
```

The function supports providing a `backward` argument for performing backward iteration for low surrogates.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( '🌷', 1, true );
// returns 127799
```

The function supports providing a negative `position`.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( 'last man standing', -13 );
// returns 32
```

## Notes

This function differs from [`String.prototype.codePointAt`][mdn-string-codepointat] in the following ways:

-   The function supports providing a negative `position`. If provided a negative `position`, the function determines the string position relative to the end of the string.
-   The function supports providing a `backward` argument for performing backward iteration for low surrogates. [`String.prototype.codePointAt`][mdn-string-codepointat] simply returns the low surrogate value if no [UTF-16][utf-16] surrogate pair begins at the specified position. If invoked with `backward` set to `true`, this function will return the code point after aggregating with the preceding high surrogate, if the specified position does not mark the start of a surrogate pair.
-   The function raises an exception if provided a `position` which exceeds the bounds of the input string.
